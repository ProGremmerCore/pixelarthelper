# PixelArtHelper
I created a pixelhelper for the 'RGB LED Panel WS2812B 16x16 256 LEDs Flexibel Led Modul 5050SMD IC'.

It's very easy to create PixelArt content with my tool.

You found an example Arduino code in my repo.

I user the FestLED library : https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

My project is created with a ESP32 Dev and i use this as case: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5737371
